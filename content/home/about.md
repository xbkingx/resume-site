## Background

I recently successfully defended my PhD thesis in Neuroscience at Brown University on the topic of brain-computer interfaces. While doctoral programs tend to produce hyper-specialized researchers, the multidisciplinary nature of neural interfaces, combined with my previous experiences as a pharmaceutical representative and technology journalist, have resulted in an undeniably unique and diverse skillset.

I'm currently seeking employment by a public or private organization fueled by massive and complex ideas at the intersection of perception, interaction, and technology. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: virtual and augmented reality, multimodal and alternative user interfaces, assistive technologies and devices, user experience, experience design, and neural interfaces.
